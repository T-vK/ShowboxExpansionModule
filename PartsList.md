### Minimal setup
The probably cheapest way to get started would be to use the following parts:
- [ESP32 D1 Mini](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006629784548.html)
- [2x Any RJ45 Female connector](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004520312413.html)
- [10x Female to Female Dupont Wires](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005501503609.html)

Depending on what features you need, you'll have to add additional parts.  
E.g. if you want to use an expression pedal or dual footswitch, you will need a [TRS jack](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001266094691.html). If you want to use MIDI, you will need the [Arduino MIDI Shield](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32806229252.html) and the [Logic Level Converter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005984772131.html) etc.
